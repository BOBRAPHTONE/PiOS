# PiOS
Simple prototype operating system for the Raspberry Pi. It aims to be a simple operating system for learning and teaching the ins and outs of operating system development in general and the architecture of a real world System on a Chip (BCM2835) in particular.    

This project is explicitly not PylotOS (the Python-Operating System). If you want that, see https://github.com/tuc-osg/pylotos 

# Goals
The main goal of the project is to learn loads of interesting facts about operating system development. Maybe it will be possible to use the operating system in OS-classes for teaching and experimenting. 

The operating system will probably not became stable enough to use in real-life. You've been warned.
